Medication Classifications:

med_oxin = 1: This identifies medications that contain patterns like "cardu", "doxa", "osin", "oxin", "hytrin", "tera", "tamsu", "alfu". These patterns match alpha-blockers and other related medications (e.g., Doxazosin, Tamsulosin).

med_triam = 0.0005: This identifies potassium-sparing diuretics like Triamterene and Amiloride, using patterns like "triam", "amil".

med_olol = 2: This identifies beta-blockers (BB), recognized by patterns such as "olol", "metop", "coreg", "carv", "lopre", "topr", "propa", "nebi", "nado", "atenelol" (e.g., Metoprolol, Carvedilol, Nebivolol).

med_ipine_azem = 5: This identifies calcium channel blockers (CCB), with patterns like "ipine", "azem", "norv", "vera", "nife", "proca", "nicar", "nefe", "caduet" (e.g., Amlodipine, Verapamil, Nifedipine).

med_minoxi = 10000: This identifies Minoxidil, using patterns like "mino", "xidil".

med_guanfacine = 0.01: This identifies Guanfacine, using the pattern "guan".

med_mra = 9: This identifies mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) like Spironolactone and Eplerenone, using patterns like "spir", "eple", "aldac", "inspra".

med_fur_bum_tors = 13: This identifies loop diuretics and similar agents, with patterns like "fur", "bum", "tors", "inda", "etha", "demadex" (e.g., Furosemide, Bumetanide, Torsemide).

med_hydral_azine = 0.5: This identifies vasodilators like Hydralazine, using patterns like "hydral", "azine".

med_pril_artan = 1000: This identifies ACE inhibitors and ARBs, recognized by patterns like "pril", "artan", "benic", "vals", "olme", "edarbi", "diovan", "azil", "trando", "micardis", "atacand" (e.g., Lisinopril, Valsartan, Olmesartan).

med_idine_clon = 100: This identifies centrally acting agents like Clonidine, using patterns like "idine", "clon", "cata".

Assigning Values:

For each medication pattern that matches, the corresponding med_ variable is updated with a specific value (e.g., 1, 0.0005, 2). 
When the med_category is 1000, it indicates that the patient is on either an ACE inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), but not both, as itâ€™s unlikely for both to be prescribed simultaneously.

If the med_category changes from 1000 to 1000.5 at the next visit, it means Hydralazine has been added to the regimen.

A med_category of 7 means that the patient is on both a CCB and a BB, as these are assigned values of 5 and 2, respectively.

If the med_category is 18, it indicates that the patient is on a CCB and a diuretic, which are assigned values of 5 and 13, respectively. No other combination of medication categories (e.g., 1, 2, 5, 9) sums to 18, confirming that these two medications are being used together.
